# markov.melodies
## Objective

Markov Melodies is an R+Python tool to enable musicians to explore music alternatives in different tonalities using Markov Chains as a basis.

## Contents

### R library
The R Library can be found under the markovMelodies folder. It includes manual pages for all functions. Additionally, you can find the R code for all functions in the main folder.

### Python script
The current python script is used for converting CSV files into MIDI files for use in the DAW of your preference. A future python-only code based on pandas is on the works.

### Examples
An examples folder provides some of the different results obtained. Currently it only covers random walks.

### Mathematical information
The TeX document with the mathematical information for the project is on the works.
